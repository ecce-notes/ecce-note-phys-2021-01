The tracking systems of ECCE allow for the measurement of lower momentum charged jets with excellent scale and resolution.  The analysis was completed with 18x275 GeV Pythia 8 electron proton collisions, requireing a $Q^2$ greater than $100$ GeV, and the prop.4 detector configuration.  The anti-$k_T$ jet finding algorithm was utilized, with a jet radius $R=0.5$.  To prevent the classification of single particles as jets, a constraint of $z<0.95$ as applied, where 
\begin{equation}
z=\frac{E_{\hbox{most energetic constituent}}}{E_{\hbox{total jet}}}.
\label{eq:jet_z}
\end{equation}

A cut on the transverse momentum of $p_T<30$ was applied to reject higher momentum tracks being reconstructed at lower momentum.

As seen in figure \ref{fig:track_momentum_scale}, the scale is better than -0.15 across entire detectors acceptance.  This, in combination with the momentum resolution better than 0.2 as shown in figure \ref{fig:track_momentum_resolution} opens up the ability to study charged jets in great detail, especially in the lower momentum regime.

In addition to the excellent momentum scale and resolution the ECCE tracking system offers, the detector offers very good spatial resolution of jets (Figure \ref{fig:track_spatial_reso_scale}).
