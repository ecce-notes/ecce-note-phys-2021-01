\section {Introduction}
\label{det_overview}

Clever intro statement\todo{some intro statement about why we care about jets that I'm really struggling to write right now}.  For instance, jets offer a probe into the kinematics of partons during ep and eA collisions.  As the partons hadronize and form their final state particles, they do so in a way that coalesce the particles into collimated streams, which we identify as a jet.  Through analysis of the distribution of jets and the scattered electron, the kinematics of the collision can be reconstructed \todo{I have no confidence in these statements}.
