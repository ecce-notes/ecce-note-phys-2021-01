\section {Introduction}
\label{det_overview}

During the hadronization process, many of the final state particles are grouped together into structures known as jets.  From these jets, the parton kinematics are able to be studied in greater detail than available from the measurement of individual particles.  Additionally, jets can yield insight into the hadronization process by studying the distribution of energy throughout a jet \cite{AbdulKhalek:2021gbh}.  Thus, it is important to know the resolution and scale which ECCE can measure jets.
